ADR01 - User Info
Problem: it is possible to have a relation between Manager and Coach in current database structure.

Solutions:
1: Proper backend code that makes it impossible to connect two users together with the same role,
or two users with a Coach/Manager role.
2: Add new tables to the database that properly defines UserInfo's with their role.

Out of these two, the second solution seems better. As it would lead a less complex backend code.
And speed with queries, because if you ever need a list of all coaches, you dont need to pull the entire userlist.

Therefore, we will work on Solution 2 and update our ERD as well for documentation purposes.
